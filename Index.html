    <h1> Open Access Simulator</h1>
    <p>The 2002 Budapest Open Access Declaration kick started what is now known as the Open Access movement. Since then, it has transformed the way that the public can access scholarly literature, breaking down the barriers to reading and accessing such works (Budapest Open Access Initiative, 2002).</p>

<p>While more and more publishers have welcomed this new model of academic publishing, there became a need for there to be a way for them to continue to make a profit. Because of this, one of the trends in academic publishing has been a shift from “pay-to-read” to “pay-to-publish,” with researchers having to offset the costs of publishing by paying for some of the publishing fees themselves (Potter & Walls, 2023). These fees can range from about $800 to about $11,000, which can be covered by grants and funding (Massarani et al., 2021).</p>

<p>However, for many institutions and researchers in the developing world, these fees are exuberant, and they are unable to afford the cost of making their research available to everyone. When you are a PhD assistant researcher in Cameroon making $350 a month, publishing in such a journal is almost impossible on such a salary. For these researchers, the issue is tackling these large author processing fees (APCs) while still being able to foster that inclusivity touted in the 2002 Budapest Declaration.</p>

    <p> Let's pretend that you are all researchers in various fields and working in different countries. You have heard about open access publishing for the first 
        time, and want to participate since <br>you see the value in it. Let's see if it'll be possible.

    <strong> Use the buttons labeled according to where you are from</strong>. <br> Over the course of the time, try to see if you can publish 20 times or more.
